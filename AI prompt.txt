Example:

I need you to write cold email subject lines. Here are examples:

✅ GOOD: "Quick question about your Q4 engineering roadmap"
✅ GOOD: "Saw your post on distributed systems—thoughts on this?"

❌ BAD: "URGENT: Limited Time Offer Inside!!!"
Why it's bad: Spam trigger words, fake urgency
❌ BAD: "You won't believe what we built..."
Why it's bad: Clickbait, no context

Produces answers that consider context instead of regurgitating best practices.




5.Template:

Answer this question: [question]

For your answer, provide:
1. Your primary answer
2. Confidence level (0-100%)
3. Key assumptions you're making
4. What would change your answer
5. Alternative answer if you're <80% confident

---

Example:

Answer this question: Will Rust replace C++ in systems programming by 2030?

For your answer, provide:
1. Your primary answer
2. Confidence level (0-100%)
3. Key assumptions you're making
4. What would change your answer
5. Alternative answer if you're <80% confident

Stops you from making decisions based on AI bullshit confidence.



6.Example:

[CONTEXT]
[paste your company's 50-page API documentation]

[FOCUS]
Only use information from CONTEXT to answer. If the answer isn't in CONTEXT, say "Insufficient information in provided context."

[TASK]
How do I implement rate limiting with retry logic for the /users endpoint?

[CONSTRAINTS]
- Cite specific sections when referencing CONTEXT
- Do not use general knowledge outside CONTEXT
- If multiple interpretations exist, list all

7.Example:

[ITERATION 1]
Create a draft sales email for reaching out to engineering VPs at Series B startups about our CI/CD optimization tool

[ITERATION 2]
Review the above output. Identify 3 weaknesses or gaps.

[ITERATION 3]
Rewrite the output addressing all identified weaknesses.

[ITERATION 4]
Final review: Is this production-ready? If not, what's missing?

Technique 8: Constraint-First Prompting

Google Brain researchers start with constraints before the actual task.

Template:

HARD CONSTRAINTS (cannot be violated):
- [constraint 1]
- [constraint 2]
- [constraint 3]

SOFT PREFERENCES (optimize for these):
- [preference 1]
- [preference 2]

TASK: [your actual request]

Confirm you understand all constraints before proceeding.

---

Example:

HARD CONSTRAINTS (cannot be violated):
- Must be written in Rust
- Cannot use any external dependencies
- Must compile on stable Rust 1.75+
- Maximum binary size: 5MB

SOFT PREFERENCES (optimize for these):
- Fast compilation time
- Minimal memory allocation

TASK: Write a CLI tool that parses 10GB CSV files and outputs JSON with schema validation

Confirm you understand all constraints before proceeding.

---

Stops the AI from giving you technically correct but practically useless answers.



9.Template:

Analyze [topic/problem] from these perspectives:

[PERSPECTIVE 1: Technical Feasibility]
[specific lens]

[PERSPECTIVE 2: Business Impact]
[specific lens]

[PERSPECTIVE 3: User Experience]
[specific lens]

[PERSPECTIVE 4: Risk/Security]
[specific lens]

SYNTHESIS:
Integrate all perspectives into a final recommendation with trade-offs clearly stated.

---

Example:

Analyze whether we should migrate from Postgres to DynamoDB from these perspectives:

[PERSPECTIVE 1: Technical Feasibility]
Engineering complexity, timeline, data migration risks

[PERSPECTIVE 2: Business Impact]
Cost implications, team velocity, vendor lock-in

[PERSPECTIVE 3: User Experience]
Latency changes, feature implications, downtime requirements

[PERSPECTIVE 4: Risk/Security]
Data consistency guarantees, backup procedures, compliance

SYNTHESIS:
Integrate all perspectives into a final recommendation with trade-offs clearly stated.

---

Gets you strategic thinking instead of surface-level advice.



10.Template:

I need to accomplish: [high-level goal]

Your task:
1. Analyze what would make the PERFECT prompt for this goal
2. Consider: specificity, context, constraints, output format, examples needed
3. Write that perfect prompt
4. Then execute it and provide the output

[GOAL]: [your actual objective]

---

Example:

I need to accomplish: Build a Python script that scrapes Twitter threads, converts them to blog posts with proper formatting, and auto-generates SEO meta descriptions

Your task:
1. Analyze what would make the PERFECT prompt for this goal
2. Consider: specificity, context, constraints, output format, examples needed
3. Write that perfect prompt
4. Then execute it and provide the output

[GOAL]: Twitter thread to blog post converter with SEO optimization

The AI writes a better prompt than you ever could, then executes it.
This is like having a prompt engineer working for you in real-time.
